zsoul - a Netsoul client in ZSH
===============================

zsoul will look at some environnment variables and/or in a configuration
file to get logging information.

zsoul doesn't actually demonize itself but print his output in a log file[1].

You can send him a SIGHUP forcing zsoul to reload his configuration file.

1: /tmp/zsoul.log by default
